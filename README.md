# Data-Visualization
This repository contains the dataset required to complete the coursework for the Data Visualization module in the MSc Data Science program at the University of Roehampton (2024â€“2025).

## Dataset Information
The Strawberry_Greenhouse.csv dataset contains environmental sensor data from a controlled greenhouse environment in the Chichester area dedicated to strawberry cultivation. It includes key parameters such as deviceId (identifying specific sensor units), humidity (monitoring moisture levels), temperature (tracking ambient temperature), and irTemperature (measuring infrared temperature of leaves). These data points facilitate real-time monitoring and optimisation of growing conditions, supporting precision agriculture techniques.
